# Ingredients

    Eggs.
    100ml soy sauce.
    100ml sake.
    100ml mirin.
    2 tablespoon of sugar.
    1 teaspoon of MSG (optional).
    2 teaspoon of Hon Dashi (optional).

# Prep

    This recipe works for refrigerated eggs. Cooking time may differ for room temperature eggs.
    Fill a bowl with water and ice and keep in the freezer. This will serve as the ice bath for the cooked eggs.
    (Optional) Prick holes into the bottom of the eggs. This will allow air to escape from the shell when boiling.

# Method

    Mix soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar, MSG and Hon Dashi in a pot. Stir thoroughly and simmer over medium heat.
    Bring another pot of water to a boil. Ensure that there is enough water to cover all the eggs. High heat should be kept on throughout the boiling process.
    Remove the soy sauce solution from the heat after ~3 minutes and let cool. This reduces the solution enhancing the flavor and also helps evaporate some of the alcohol.
    Boil eggs for 7 minutes. This can be adjusted depending on how many eggs you are preparing. The cold mass of the eggs will bring the temperature of the water down, which might result in hard to peel eggs if not fully hard-boiled.
    Yeet them eggs into the ice bath. Start peeling them bad boys.
    Place peeled eggs into a zip-lock bag and pour the soy sauce solution in. Ensure all eggs are all fully submerged to prevent uneven spotting.
    Remove excess air from the zip-lock bag and seal. Let rest in the fridge for a minimum of 12 hours.

# Notes

    Eggs taste best after marinating for 24 hours. Note the eggs will get saltier if rested in the soy sauce solution longer.
    Dipping the eggs in the ice bath while peeling makes the shell come off easier.
    The soy sauce solution can be reused for another batch of eggs! The number of times this can be done safely is an exercise left for the reader :)
